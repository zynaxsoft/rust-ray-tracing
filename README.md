# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

My work on following the implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in Rust!

The code simply follows the designs and the guidelines of the book. I am sure there are rooms of improvement to make it more Rust-like. If you have any suggestion please let me know !

## Usage

### executing manually
1. `cargo run`
2. Open the image `demo.ppm` with the image viewer of your choice.

### using script
Execute `demo.sh`
Note: The script require ImageMagick and feh (`apt install ImageMagick feh`)`
